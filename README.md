### JBProxy
  A proxy to communicate between MCJE and MCBE 
  Progress: lesser than 10%
 
  How does it work? Easy. Proxy starts and you can connect via plugin on Nukkit or Spigot. 
  NOTE: THIS IS PROXY FOR COMMUNICATING INFORMATIONS, NOT FOR HANDLING MC CLIENTS. IT MEANS, THAT YOU CAN'T CONNECT TO SERVER ON THIS PORT
 
  Project is based on [Nemisys project by NukkitX]
