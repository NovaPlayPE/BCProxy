### JBProxy
  A proxy to communicate between MCJE and MCBE 
  Progress: lesser than 20%
 
  How does it work? Easy. Proxy starts and you can connect via plugin on Nukkit or Spigot. 
  NOTE: THIS PROXY IF FOR COMMUNICATING INFORMATIONS, NOT FOR HANDLING MC CLIENTS. IT MEANS, THAT YOU CAN'T CONNECT TO SERVER ON THIS PORT
 
  Project is based on amazing Nemisys project by NukkitX(http://github.com/NukkitX/Nemisys)
  Project is based and also powered by amazing Bluplayz library(http://github.com/Bluplayz/LibraryHandler)
